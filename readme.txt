I built my Reviung41 mid April of 2021.
I got the kit from https://boardsource.xyz/
It's got an Elite-C MCU, Durock T1 Tactile switches,
and the keycaps are a set pieced together from:
https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=4714
and
https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=4713
This is my first keyboard smaller than a tenkeyless, so it has taken some getting used to.
Still trying to get a layout that I find intuitive and useful.
