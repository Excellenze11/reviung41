* I built my Reviung41 mid April of 2021.
* I got the kit from [boardsource.xyz](https://boardsource.xyz/)
* It has an Elite-C MCU, Durock T1 Tactile switches,
* Keycaps from: [here](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=4714)
and
[here](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=4713)
* This is my first keyboard smaller than a tenkeyless, so it has taken some getting used to.
* Still trying to get a layout that I find intuitive and useful.

Still need to:
* add led's
* black mcu cover
